## Summary

This design document details the database schema for the `projects`, `project_users`, and `project_invitations` tables. The `projects` table records the details for each project including a reference to the user which created the table. The `project_users` table establishes a many-to-many relationship, associating multiple users as members of multiple projects with specific roles. The `project_invitations` table is used to manage project invitations. Before a user can join a project, they must be invited and accept the invitation. The project created is automatically invited and added to the project as an 'owner'.

## Rationale

The design of this database schema is driven by the need for robust access control and data integrity. The `projects` table allows for the creation of projects, with the creator's details stored in the `created_by` column. This field is retained as metadata and does not confer any specific role or permission within the project.

The `project_users` table establishes a many-to-many relationship between users and projects. It includes the role of each user, providing clarity on project ownership and permissions. The `project_invitations` table manages project invitations, further enhancing the control over project membership.

Row Level Security (RLS) policies are implemented to enforce access control. These policies limit access to a project's users based on their associated roles. Currently, all project users have the 'owner' role. Additional roles may be added in the future.

The `mesa` and `private` schemas are used to logically group related tables and functions. The `private` schema is used for security-definer functions, which run with the privileges of the user who created them, not the user who invokes them. This is useful for bypassing RLS when necessary, for performance or access.

The new types (`mesa.project_user_role`, `mesa.invitation_status`) and domains (`mesa.title`, `mesa.name`, `mesa.bps`) are used to enforce constraints on the data. This is a best practice in SQL to ensure data integrity and consistency.

The new functions are used to enforce business rules and data integrity. For example, `private.mesa_check_project_user_role` checks if a user has a specific role in a project, and `private.mesa_handle_row_meta` handles the metadata of a row (created_by, created_at, updated_at). These functions are created as security-definer functions in the `private` schema, which allows them to bypass RLS when necessary, without being exposed to the outside world. CAUTION: The `private` schema should never be in the "Exposed schemas" inside your API settings, as this would expose the security-definer functions to the outside world ([1](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security#using-security-definer-functions)).

## Requirements

1. Create two new schemas: `mesa` and `private`. The `mesa` schema will contain the main tables, while the `private` schema will contain security-definer functions.

2. Create a `projects` table in the `mesa` schema with the following columns:
   - `id`: unique identifier for the project.
   - `title`: title of the project.
   - `description`: description of the project.
   - `created_by`: reference to the `auth.users` table, representing the user who created the project.
   - `created_at`: timestamp of when the project was created.
   - `updated_at`: timestamp of the last update to the project.

3. Create a `project_users` table in the `mesa` schema to associate multiple users as members of multiple projects in a many-to-many relationship with the following columns:
   - `project_id`: reference to the `projects` table.
   - `user_id`: reference to the `auth.users` table.
   - `user_role`: role of the user in the project, using the `mesa.project_user_role` type.
   - `user_name`: name of the user.
   - `user_bps`: the user's percentage split in the project, stored in BPS.
   - `invitation_id`: reference to the `project_invitations` table, representing the invitation that the user accepted to join the project.
   - `created_by`: reference to the `auth.users` table, representing the user who added this member.
   - `created_at`: timestamp of when the user was added.
   - `updated_at`: timestamp of the last update to the row.

4. Create a `project_invitations` table in the `mesa` schema to manage project invitations with the following columns:
   - `id`: unique identifier for the invitation.
   - `project_id`: reference to the `projects` table.
   - `user_id`: reference to the `auth.users` table, representing the invited user.
   - `user_role`: role of the invited user in the project, using the `mesa.project_user_role` type.
   - `created_by`: reference to the `auth.users` table, representing the user who created the invitation.
   - `created_at`: timestamp of when the invitation was created.
   - `updated_at`: timestamp of the last update to the invitation.
   - `status`: status of the invitation, using the `mesa.invitation_status` type.

5. When a project is deleted, all members and invitations should be removed from the project by using `ON DELETE CASCADE` with the references from the `project_users` and `project_invitations` tables.

6. The `service_role` should have full access to the `mesa` schema and the `private` schema. This allows the `service_role` to perform administrative tasks and to run security definer functions.

7. Implement the following process for creating a project and adding a user to a project:

- When a project is created, the creator is automatically added to the `project_invitations` table as the owner with an 'accepted' status. This is enforced by a trigger on the `projects` table that calls the `private.mesa_handle_project_created` function.
- To add a new user to a project, an invitation is created in the `project_invitations` table. This invitation can only be created by the project owner.
- The invited user can accept or reject the invitation. If they accept, they are added to the `project_members` table. This is enforced by a trigger on the `project_invitations` table that calls the `private.mesa_handle_invitation_accepted` function.

8. Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on the `projects`, `project_invitations`, and `project_users` tables. This is done to ensure that only authorized users can access and manipulate the data in these tables.

9. Define the following RLS policies:

- For the `projects` table:
  - Allow authenticated users to insert their own projects. This is enforced by checking that the `created_by` field matches the user's ID.
  - Allow authenticated users to select, update, and delete their own projects. This is enforced by checking that the user has the 'owner' role in the project.

- For the `project_invitations` table:
  - Allow authenticated users to update their own invitations. This is enforced by checking that the `status` is 'open' and the `user_id` matches the user's ID. The update is allowed if the new `status` is either 'accepted' or 'rejected' and the `user_id` still matches the user's ID.
  - Allow project owners to close invitations. This is enforced by checking that the `status` is 'open' and the user has the 'owner' role in the project. The update is allowed if the new `status` is either 'closed' or 'open' and the user still has the 'owner' role in the project.

- For the `project_users` table:
  - Allow authenticated users to select, update, and delete their own project users. This is enforced by checking that the user has the 'owner' role in the project.

10. Grant usage permissions on the `mesa` schema to the `authenticated` and `service_role` roles. This allows these roles to access the tables in the `mesa` schema.

11. Grant all privileges on all tables, routines, functions, and sequences in the `mesa` schema to the `service_role` and `postgres` roles. This allows these roles to perform any operation on the objects in the `mesa` schema.

These requirements ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the data.

## Conclusion

The database schema for the `projects`, `project_users`, and `project_invitations` tables is designed to ensure proper access control and data integrity. By focusing on the relationships between users and projects, and implementing the necessary RLS policies, we can ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the data. Future versions of the schema may include additional features based on user feedback and needs.
